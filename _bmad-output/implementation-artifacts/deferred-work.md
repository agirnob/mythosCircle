# Deferred Work Ledger

Findings routed to `defer` during reviews, kept for future planning and story tracing.

## Deferred from: code review of spec-1-2-versioned-world-store (2026-08-30)

- Undo rejects unknown event types with `CorruptEventError` — forward-compat break when later stories (session events, media manifest, queue) append new event types to the shared log; extend per new type. [backend/app/store/undo.py]
- No log-vs-materialized audit/verification surface — no replay/consistency helper exists; `CorruptEventError` reachable only via undo. [backend/app/store/]
- Read helpers cannot distinguish unknown campaign from empty world — 1.6 API mapping must handle 404s itself. [backend/app/store/read.py]
- Edge counters have no semantic/range validation — pipeline stories assign counter meanings. [backend/app/store/models.py]
- `backup.sh` lacks a single-instance guard (cron vs manual overlap) — 1.7 ops item. [deploy/backup.sh]
- Frontend has no wire-contract foundation — 1.6 builds the OpenAPI-client/api/error-envelope layer. [frontend/src/]

## Deferred from: code review of spec-1-3-persistent-generation-queue (2026-08-30)

- source_spec: `spec-1-3-persistent-generation-queue.md`
  summary: 409 duplicate-job response offers no path to the existing job — a retry-heavy client must follow up with GET /api/jobs/{id} after a 409.
  evidence: the 201 reply carries no Location header and the 409 envelope includes no job state; idempotent-retry ergonomics are unaddressed by the wire contract.
- source_spec: `spec-1-3-persistent-generation-queue.md`
  summary: `deploy/config.toml` `[queue] max_in_flight_per_campaign = 1` (running-only semantics) conflicts with the runtime env cap `MYTHOSCIRCLE_MAX_PENDING_PER_CAMPAIGN` (queued+running, default 10) with no cross-reference.
  evidence: config consumption is deferred to Story 1.7; the two limits overlap in name and semantics — 1.7 must reconcile and document the relationship.
- source_spec: `spec-1-3-persistent-generation-queue.md`
  summary: WS `job_cancelled`/`job_done`/`job_failed` (terminal) carry no `queue_position` — subscribers tracking other pending jobs must re-poll the list after every terminal transition.
  evidence: AD-17's shape pins `queue_position?` as optional; per-subscriber position or a position-delta was out of scope for 1.3 — revisit when the frontend wires the queue view.
